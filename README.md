# cv2PYNQ
This Python package accelerates [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) image filtering functions for the [PYNQ](http://www.pynq.io/) platform.
The library implements a specific set of popular image filters and feature detection algorithms.
The calculation of time-consuming tasks is implemented in the Programmable Logic (PL) of the ZYNQ chip.
cv2PYNQ also includes the Video-Subsystem of the [base](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ) project of PYNQ.
Therefore, the HDMI In and Out interfaces can be used in your application.
The library calculates every filter for gray-channel images with 1080p within 16 ms if the input and output buffers 
are located in the contiguous memory of the chip. 

## Get Started
Install by typing: 
```
sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/Siudya/cv2pynq.git 
``` 
into the terminal on your Pynq-Z1 or Pynq-Z2 board.   
The library comes with a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/wbrueckner/cv2pynq/blob/master/notebooks/cv2PYNQ%20-%20Get%20Started.ipynb) to demonstrate its usage and capabilities.
You find the notebook in the cv2PYNQ folder of your home tree after installation.
